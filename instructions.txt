This guide will help you install Docker, import the dialog-manager image, and start the system with full audio and MQTT support.
Step 1: Install Docker (If not already installed)

Open a terminal and run the following commands to install the Docker Engine and the Compose plugin:
Bash

# Update your package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker and Compose
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2

# Allow your user to run Docker without 'sudo'
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# IMPORTANT: You must Log Out and Log Back In for the group change to take effect.

Step 2: Load the Image File

Locate the dialog-manager.tar.gz file you received. In your terminal, navigate to that folder and run:
Bash

# This imports the image into your local Docker library
docker load -i dialog-manager.tar.gz

# Verify it worked (you should see 'dialog-dialog-manager' in the list)
docker images

Step 3: Setup Audio Permissions (Host Machine)

Since the container needs to use your microphone and speakers, you must ensure your PulseAudio server is ready to accept the connection:
Bash

# Ensure the PulseAudio socket is active
pactl load-module module-native-protocol-unix socket=/run/user/$(id -u)/pulse/native

Step 4: Run the System

You have two options to start the container. Option A is recommended.

Option A: Using Docker Compose (Best) Ensure the docker-compose.yaml file is in the same folder as your models. Run:
Bash

docker compose up

Option B: Using Docker Run (Manual) If you don't want to use the Compose file, run this single command:
Bash

docker run -it --rm \
  --name tts_client \
  --net=app-network \
  -e MQTT_BROKER=localhost \
  -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:/run/user/1000/pulse/native \
  -v /run/user/1000/pulse/native:/run/user/1000/pulse/native \
  -v ~/.config/pulse/cookie:/tmp/pulse-cookie \
  --user 1000 \
  dialog-dialog-manager:latest
